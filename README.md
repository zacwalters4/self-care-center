# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract: 
  The Self-Care center app allows the user to receive and affirmation or mantra, as well as save this message into a list of favorites. Users can then view the list of favorites on another page of the app.
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### Installation Instructions: 
  The User will simply need to clone the app onto their local machine, navigate into the directory, and run open index.html.
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### Preview of App:

### Context:
  Currently I have finished 3 weeks of the Turing program, and this app took around 2 hours a day over 4 or 5 days to create.
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

### Wins + Challenges:
  Most challenges and wins came from learning flexbox solo, I ran into so many small formatting challenges on the webpage, but learning flexbox solved most if not all of them once I got used to it. Learning flexbox through trial and error was really finicky and so I'd say that I had many more than 2-3 wins overcoming the challenges it presented on the main webpage.
