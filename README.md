# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract: 
  The Self-Care center app allows the user to receive and affirmation or mantra, as well as save this message into a list of favorites. Users can then view the list of favorites on another page of the app.

### Installation Instructions: 
  The User will simply need to clone the app onto their local machine, navigate into the directory, and run open index.html.

### Wins + Challenges:
  Most challenges and wins came from learning flexbox solo, I ran into so many small formatting challenges on the webpage, but learning flexbox solved most if not all of them once I got used to it. Learning flexbox through trial and error was really finicky and so I'd say that I had many more than 2-3 wins overcoming the challenges it presented on the main webpage.
